### TDD with Python

```
Terminology: Functional Test == Acceptance Test == End-to-End Test
What I call functional tests, some people prefer to call acceptance tests, or
end-to-end tests. The main point is that these kinds of tests look at how the
whole application functions, from the outside. Another term is black box test,
because the test doesn’t know anything about the internals of the system under
test.

TDD isn’t something that comes naturally. It’s a discipline, like a martial art, and just like in a Kung-Fu movie, you need a bad-tempered and unreasonable master to force you to learn the discipline. Ours is the Testing Goat.

This book is my attempt to share with the world the journey I’ve taken from
"hacking" to "software engineering". It’s mainly about testing, but
 there’s a lot more to it, as you’ll soon see.

"I’m still quite early on in my programming career. They say that in any
discipline, you go from apprentice, to journeyman, and eventually, sometimes,
on to master. I’d say that I’m—at best—a journeyman programmer.
But I was lucky enough, early on in my career, to fall in with a bunch of TDD
fanatics, and it made such a big impact on my programming that
I’m burning to share it with everyone."

"Then came the fearful goddess Complexity. She soon showed me the limits
of my experience."
