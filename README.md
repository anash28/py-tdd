### TDD with Python

This book is my attempt to share with the world the journey I’ve taken from
"hacking" to "software engineering". It’s mainly about testing, but
 there’s a lot more to it, as you’ll soon see.

"I’m still quite early on in my programming career. They say that in any
discipline, you go from apprentice, to journeyman, and eventually, sometimes,
on to master. I’d say that I’m—at best—a journeyman programmer.
But I was lucky enough, early on in my career, to fall in with a bunch of TDD
fanatics, and it made such a big impact on my programming that
I’m burning to share it with everyone."

"Then came the fearful goddess Complexity. She soon showed me the limits
of my experience."
```
```
TDD isn’t something that comes naturally. It’s a discipline, like a martial art,
 and just like in a Kung-Fu movie, you need a bad-tempered and unreasonable
 master to force you to learn the discipline. Ours is the Testing Goat.
